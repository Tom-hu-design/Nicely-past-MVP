<h3> Nicely is a real time emotion indicator that uses your public social media activities to regulate your mood.</h3>
<p>Version number: v1.0.0</p>

<h2>More about Nicely</h2>
<p>Nicely is a mental health assessment tool engineered to provide an intricate analysis of an individual's social media interactions and daily life experiences. We aim to provide more frequent, reliable, and objective data to an industry notorious for discontinuous and subjective processes, thereby fostering closer client to provider relationship and better results. This, in turn, elevates the overall efficacy of diagnostic procedures, follow-up interventions, and crisis management protocols.</p>

<h2>Nicely's Goal</h2>
<p>Nicely allows university students who struggle to navigate conversations with their college counselors to convey their most vulnerable thoughts comfortably and eliminate grey zones in between therapy sessions to provide quantifiable and effective mental health services.</p>
